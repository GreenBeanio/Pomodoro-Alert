# Pomodoro-Alert
## What Does It Do?
Follows a pomodoro ultradian rhythm. When clicking the start button it calculates the time and schedule. Every time the activity switches it will make a noise. You click the sound button to stop the sound. Clicking stop with restart the program, so be careful about that.

## Reason For Creation
This program was made for me to try and use the pomodoro time schedule.
There were two different day types. Both have 1 hours lunch breaks. The difference is that one has 8 work hours and the other has 7 work hours.
